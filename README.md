# Pan-Cancer TF Footprinting & Noncoding Mutation Data Integration
Suffian Azizan

# Background

This repo documents a crucial step in my current pan-cancer study that makes use of restricted ATAC-seq and DNAse-seq datasets generated from healthy and cancerous human tissue samples available in the public databases (i.e.Â TCGA and BLUEPRINT). I collated raw data from these databases to generate TF footprinting data from the open chromatin regions. The TF footprinting data is then combined with the noncoding mutation data from the same samples obtained via variant calling to identify TF binding sites (TFBS) that carry variant alleles (potentially somatic mutations) that may modulate TF footprint scores (proxy for TF binding activity).
